A trait is a collection of methods defined for an unknown type: Self. Traits allow to define shared behavior in an abstract way. Traits are similar to interfaces in other languages, with some differences. A type's behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type, and different types share the same behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those types. Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures together to define a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose.\""
